<p>Hi, I'm Mr.AK, the owner and chef of AK Eat's. I started this restaurant in 2010 with a simple mission: to provide delicious and healthy vegetarian food to my community. I have always been passionate about cooking and eating plant-based dishes, and I wanted to share my love for food with others. I believe that eating vegetarian is not only good for your health, but also for the environment and the animals. That's why I use only fresh and organic ingredients, and prepare everything from scratch. My menu features a variety of cuisines, from Indian and Italian, from Pasta salads. I also cater to vegan, gluten-free, and allergy-friendly customers. Whether you're a vegetarian or not, I invite you to try my food and see for yourself how tasty and satisfying it can be. Thank you for choosing Veggie Delight!</p>
